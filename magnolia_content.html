    <h3>Magnolia</h3>
    
    <p>Magnolia trees are prized for their large flowers that perfume the balmy spring air with a sweet, heady fragrance. Their magnificent tulip- or star-shaped flowers can be as large as saucers when fully opened. They range in color from pink, purple, white and even yellow. Some varieties have double blossoms.</p>
    
    <p> Most varieties tolerate hot summers and some drought. But younger trees will need to be watered regularly for two years until they're established. Drip irrigation is your friend. Pruning: Magnolias don't need much pruning other than to lop off damaged branches or to shape up the tree to keep it pretty.</p>
