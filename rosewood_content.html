    <h3>Rosewood</h3>
    
    <p>Rosewood is a deep, ruddy brown to purplish-brown colour, richly streaked and grained with black resinous layers. It takes a fine polish but because of its resinous nature is difficult to work.</p>
    
    <p>The trees are also exploited to produce rosewood oil, which is used for its supposed analgesic, antidepressant, antiseptic, aphrodisiac, antibacterial, and cephalic properties. Because of its popularity, rosewood trees have been heavily harvested, resulting in all kinds of rosewood species becoming increasingly scarce.</p>
